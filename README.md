# CFGs

These are my configs for my dwm and stuff.

You can run the install script to get all the packages and put the configs in the right spots. Make sure it is executable with ```chmod +x install.sh```, and then run it with ```./install.sh```.
There are no releases, so you should clone this repo to get everything inside it.
